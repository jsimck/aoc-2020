# AoC-2020

> **[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)** edition written in typescript/NodeJS.

The goal of this repository is not to do the best of the best implementation and finding to best solution to Advent of Code challenges, but simply to exercise and improve my knowledge of NodeJS and Typescript.

```
npm run build
npm start [[1, 2, 3 ... 25]]
```
